# SupplierApp
This is an android app meant to help suppliers calculate 
profit, tax paid, amount he/she expects to recieve(selling price) 
after tax is deducted and profit is added to the initial buying price and also the total price after multiplying
the selling price of one item by the qauntity.

The concept is simple. 
The user enters amount (in this case buying price) and without a button the app calculates the profit,tax and total.
The tax is (16% * Buying price)
The profit is (100+ entered profit/user profit in percent)
The qauntity is entered by the user.
The total price is (selling price * quantity)
While selling price is (Buying prie * tax(0.16) * profit * 1( intial quantity is 1))

Future Modifications can be made to solve problems that suppliers go through.
